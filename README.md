=====================
==== Even Or Odd=====
=====================

Objective:
This application is designed to detect if the entered number by the user is even or odd.

How It Is designed:
Firstly, we need to define a variable and make the user enter the value of it in numbers.
Then we use the if condition and the remainder operator.
If the value of the variable % 2 = 1, then the number is odd.
If the value of the variable % 2 = 0, then the number is even.

Note: any decimal number entered will be converted into an integer number as the variable type is int.
